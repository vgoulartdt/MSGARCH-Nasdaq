# MSGARCH-Nasdaq

Modeling the NASDAQ's daily log-returns using the MSGARCH package in R. The purpose of this project is to explore volatility dynamics and detect regime changes using a Markov-switching approach. Specifically, the code implements an eGARCH specification combined with the skewed student-t (sstd) distribution to better capture the behavior and heavy-tailed nature of financial time series.

This repository uses the **MSGARCH** package.
